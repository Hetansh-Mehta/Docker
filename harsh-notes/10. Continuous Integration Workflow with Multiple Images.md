## Workflow Overview <a name="WorkflowOverview"></a>

In general, the worflow is going to be similar to a single image. Although instead of building the production image on Elastic Beanstalk, this time we will push the built image to Docker Hub from where Elastic Beanstalk can pull the built image and deploy. So everything is going to be done by Travis and that also once.
Here is the workflow in steps:

## Production Dockerfiles <a name="ProductionDockerfile"></a>
- Like mentioned earlier, Travis CI build the images and push them to Docker Hub, so that Elastic Beanstalk does not have to build the image.
- Just like earlier, we keep development and production docker files separate. Production Dockerfile is called **Dockerfile** and Development Dockerfile **Dockerfile.dev**
- The production Dockerfiles for Server, Nginx and Worker are going to be same as the development files and the only difference would be the way Server and Worker servers start. From package.json, we see that `npm run start` is used for production and `nodemon` for development.
