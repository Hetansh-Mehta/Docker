## Development Workflow <a name="DevelopmentWorkflow"></a>

- Development workflow is essentially divided into 3 parts **development**, **testing** and **deployment**.
- Building a software involves the above 3 processes which are then looped back to **development** creating a repeating cycle. This is because not every software built once is perfect.
- Instead we deploy an app, do some additional development and redeploy the app.
