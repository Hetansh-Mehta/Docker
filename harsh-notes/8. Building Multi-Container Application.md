- The application is basically a fibonacci calculator at a particular index which uses multi-container deployment.
- Note, the below architecture is a bit complicated on purpose to explore the multi-container deployment.
- This is what the end application would look like:

- The backend architecture of the application is going to look like the below image. Note, this is just the development architecture, production will be different:

- When the user boots up their browser, they are first going to visit an nginx web server which is essentially going to do some routing.
- The Nginx server is going to decide if the incoming request wants to access the frontend (React Server) or access APIs to fetch data (Express Server).
- Postgres database will be used for storing the values already seen by the user and Redis server will be used to cache the calculated values (temporary values).
- To sum up, when a user clicks on the submit button, the react app is going to make a request to the express server to write the value to the redis and postgres servers.
