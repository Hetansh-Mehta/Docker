## Creating Docker Images <a name="CreatingImages"></a>

* Dockerfile will be passed to Docker CLI
* Which is fed to Docker server and creates image
* Flow of creating Dockerfile:
    - Specify base image
    - Run commands to install additional programs
    - Specify command to run on container startup

## Building a Docker file <a name="BuildingDFile"></a>

`docker build .`
This command creates the image by running the Dockerfile in
    the provided directory.

E.g. Creating an image that runs redis server:
```
# Use an existing docker image as a base
FROM alpine
# Download and install a dependency
RUN apk add --update redis
# Tell the image what to do when it starts
# as a container.
CMD ["redis-server"]
```


![build image](./Images/buildImage.png)

Since I already have alpine downloaded, it directly accesses the image from the local cache and can be used for creating containers from the alpine image.

Copy the id and execute `docker run <image id>`
