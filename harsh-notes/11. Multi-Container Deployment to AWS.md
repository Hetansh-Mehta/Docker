## Multi-Container Definition Files <a name="MultiContainerFiles"></a>
- We saw for a single Dockerfile app, we did not have to setup any configuration on Elastic BeanStalk to build an image and run the image, it was automatic.
- But for this section, we are dealing with multiple docker files and hence setup is required.
- So, we create a file in our project directory called **Dockerrun.aws.json** which will tell EBS where to pull all of our images from and some associated information.
- Note: **Docker-compose is primarily meant for development environment**
- **Dockerrun.aws.json** is very similar to defining a docker-compose file. Rather than referring to each Dockerfile as a service, we call them container definition. The biggest difference is that docker-compose specifies how to build an image using dockerfile. But in the case of **Dockerrun.aws.json**, we already have built images pulled from Docker Hub.
- So we will configure it to fetch images from Docker hub and use it for each of the container definitions.
