* An image contains the binaries and the dependencies for the application and the metadata on how to run it.
* Official definition: “An image is an ordered collection of root filesystem changes and the corresponding execution parameters for use within a container runtime.”
* Inside the image, there’s not actually a complete OS. There’s no kernel, kernel modules (e.g. drivers).
* An image can be as small as one file (the app binary) like a golang static binary
* Or it could be as big as a Ubuntu distro with apt, and Apache, PHP, and more installed.
