## 1. Creating and Using Containers <a name="Containers"></a>
- Check versions of our docker cli and engine
- Create a Nginx (web server) container
- Common container management commands
- Docker Networking Basics


## 2. Docker Commands <a name="Commands"></a>

Syntax for docker management commands: <br>
NEW: `docker <management_command> <sub_command> (options)` <br>
OLD: `docker <command> (options)`


* `docker version` <br>
    This command simply returns the version of our client and the server (also called the engine) which runs in the background on our machine - called a daemon on macOS. Our docker command line is actually talking to the server on the machine and returning its values as well as the client’s values.

    ![docker version](./Images/dockerVersion.png =250x)
    


* `docker info` <br>
This command returns a lot more stuff than just the version. It’ll actually give us a lot of details about our configuration and setup for our engine.
![docker info](./Images/dockerInfo.png)

* `docker` <br>
This returns a list of all the commands we can use in Docker.

## 3. Starting an Nginx Web Server <a name="Nginx"></a>
- Image vs. Container
- Run/Stop/Remove Containers
- Check container logs and processes

### 3.1. Image vs Container <a name="ImagevsContainer"></a>
An **image** is the binaries and libraries and source code that make up our application, i.e., image is the application we want to run.

A **container** is the running instance of the image. We can have many containers based off the same image.

We’re going to use the Open Source Nginx web server. So we’ll be starting our containers based off that Nginx image. We get all our images from registries. 
Docker’s default image registry is called [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com).

### 3.2. Run/Stop/Remove Container <a name="RunStopContainer"></a>

* `docker container run —publish 80:80 nginx` <br>
    - Downloads image ‘nginx’ from Docker Hub
    - Starts a new container from the image
    - Opened port 80 on the host IP (local machine) and sends all traffic from it to the executable running inside that container on the container (container IP) on port 80.
    - Since Nginx is a web server, the traffic just forwards automatically through the web browser to the localhost and into that container
    
    Note that we’ll get a “bind” error if the left number (host port) is being used by anything else, even another container. We can use any port we want on the left, like `8080:80` or `8888:80`, then use `localhost:8888` when testing.

    ![docker publish](./Images/dockerPublish.png)

    Switch over to a web browser, and type localhost.

    ![localhost](./Images/localhost.png)

    Out Nginx Server is listening.

    We can hit refresh several times and we’ll see the log entries in our command line.

    ![localhost](./Images/detachCommandLine.png)

    But we don’t always want this running in the foreground inside of our command line. 

* `docker container run —publish 80:80 —detach nginx` <br>
    The `--detach` tells Docker to run it in the background. And we get back the unique container ID of our container. Every time we run a new container, we get a new container ID.   

    ![detach](./Images/detach.png)

* `docker container ls` <br>
    Command to list all our containers. And we’ll see the one that’s still running here.

    ![container ls](./Images/dockercontainerLS.png)
