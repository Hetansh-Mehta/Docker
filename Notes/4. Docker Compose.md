# 1. Docker Compose
Docker Compose is a combination of command line tool and a configuration file. It is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

Our containers will often require other containers such as SQL or a key value. With Compose, we use a YAML file to configure the application's services. Then, with a single command, we create and start all the services from the configuration.

Using Compose is basically a three-step process:
1. Define the app's environment with a `Dockerfile` so it can be reproduced anywhere.
2. Define the services that make up the app in `docker-compose.yml` so they can be run together in an isolated environment. This file specifies the containers, the networks, volumes/data mounts, images and other configuration that is required to set up the application.
3. Run `docker-compose up` and Compose starts and runs the entire app.

`docker-compose.yml` file [template](./Dockerfile-Samples/compose-sample-1/template.yml):
```yml
version: '3.1'  # If no version is specified then v1 is assumed. Recommend v2 minimum

services:  # Containers. Same as docker run

  servicename: # A friendly name. this is also DNS name inside network (similar to --name flag in docker run)
    image: # Optional if you use build:
    command: # Optional, replace the default CMD specified by the image
    environment: # Optional, same as -e in docker run
    volumes: # Optional, same as -v in docker run
  
  servicename2:

volumes: # Optional, same as docker volume create

networks: # Optional, same as docker network create
```

Example:
```yaml
version: "3.9"

services:

    redis:
        image: redis:alpine
        ports:
            - "6379"
        networks:
            - frontend
        deploy:
            replicas: 2
            update_config:
                parallelism: 2
                delay: 10s
            restart_policy:
                condition: on-failure
    
    db:
        image: postgres:9.4
        volumes:
            - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
        networks:
            - backend
        deploy:
            placement:
                max_replicas_per_node: 1
                constraints:
                    - "node.role=manager"

networks:
    frontend:
    backend:

volumes:
    db-data:
```

Referring back to bind mounts, we had started a container using the following command:
```commandline
$ cd ./Dockerfile-Samples/bindmount-sample-1

$ docker container run -p 80:4000
-v $(pwd):/site
bretfisher/jekyll-serve
```

We can achieve the same result using the following [`docker-compose.yml` file](./Dockerfile-Samples/compose-sample-1/docker-compose.yml):
```yaml
version: 2

services:
    
    jekyll:
        image: bretfisher/jekyll-serve
        ports:
            - '80:4000'
        volumes:
            - .:/site

# Command:
#  docker container run -p 80:4000 -v $(pwd):/site bretfisher/jekyll-serve
```

Some more examples of docker-compose.yml:
- [Example 1](./Dockerfile-Samples/compose-sample-1/compose-2.yml): Passes environment variables using a `key:value` format.
- [Example 2](./Dockerfile-Samples/compose-sample-1/compose-3.yml): Passes environment variables using a list `- env_var` format. Also introduces the `depends_on` parameter to define relationship between the services.


# 2. docker-compose CLI
Docker compose command line tool is actually a separate binary from the docker tool. It's not designed to be a production-grade tool. It is ideal for local development and testing things really quickly that might be otherwise be complex.

The two most common commands are:
- `docker-compose up`: It's a single command to do everything in the compose file, including creating volumes, creating networks, starting all the containers with all their configuration options.
- `docker-compose down`: Clean-up everything that was created. Get rid of containers and remove the networks and volumes that aren't needed anymore.

Consider the following [`docker-compose.yml` file](./Dockerfile-Samples/compose-sample-2/docker-compose.yml):
```yaml
version: '3'

services:

    # Nginx server is configured as a proxy (using nginx.conf file)
    proxy:
        image: nginx:1.13 # this will use the latest version of 1.13.x
        ports:
            - '80:80' # expose 80 on host and sent to 80 in container
        volumes:
            - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf:ro    # bind mount nginx.conf file as ro (READ ONLY)
    
    # Apache 2 web server 
    web:
        image: httpd  # this will use httpd:latest
```

The [`nginx.conf`](./Dockerfile-Samples/compose-sample-2/nginx.conf) file tells Nginx to be a *reverse proxy* instead of being a web-server.

Running `docker-compose up` does the following:
- start up both containers and create a private network for them.
- bind mount the `nginx.conf` file, open the required ports.
- start dumping out logs

`localhost` on the browser shows the following:

The traffic is actually going through the Nginx reverse proxy. It repeats the traffic over to the Apache server. The Apache server is responding with its default basic HTML file because we didn't change anything. The Nginx is repeating the response back to us. <br>
This is a basic web-server/web-proxy configuration and we can clearly see that the traffic hit the proxy first and then the web-server.

We can run similar CLI commands like:
- `docker-compose up -d`: Run 
- `docker-compose ps`: List containers
- `docker-compose top`: Display the running processes inside the container
- `docker-compose down`: Stop and remove containers, networks, images, and volumes
